            want to start a project and realize that you don't have those
            foundational building blocks readily available for you to use and
            jumpstart your creation, allowing you to focus on the core business

            If I had to suggest how to fix this (and once again, I'm no expert
            in this field), I would suggest that the Deno team opened a
            submission form that allowed developers to request sponsorship to
            develop Deno-related packages. It doesn't need to be a ton of money,
            but $50 to $500 monthly (depending on package size/adoption) would
            do wonders to improve community support.

            Being able to find tutorials to build basically anything is not

            people have done dozens of tutorials on about basically everything
            at this point. This, however, is not the case for Deno. When trying
            to search for a resource with Deno, you will often find articles
            about Deno itself and not its modules. While I'm doing my part and
            also writing about it and making modules to be used in Deno, I'm

            I have recently had a conversation on Discord about the difficulty
            to find resources on Deno and the moderation joined the

            #resources channel to share blog posts and articles around Deno, so
            let's see how that's gonna develop over the coming weeks. Maybe
            having a centralized location to gather all resources on how to
            build software with Deno helps alleviating the difficulty of finding
            that content through Google.

            page, you might be wondering why I've created a syntax highlighter.
            Well, this is the reason: There is no easy way to easily create
            highlighted JSX for Preact/React components. Deno offers some form
            of conversion from <span class="shl-inline">.md</span> files to{" "}
            <span class="shl-inline">HTML</span>, but that's not exactly helpful
            for this Fresh-based website. Not only I didn't need the HTML files,
            but I also needed that only a portion of the content was
            highlighted, not the whole thing.
          </p>
          {/* What my first attempt ended up as */}
          <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            I eventually gave up and resorted to using a syntax highlighting JS
            package that updates the page content after load, but that deviates
            from the intend of Fresh to ship as little Javascript to the client
            as possible, none at all if it can help it. The problem with this
            approach is that it caused Cumulative Layout Shift and a jarring
            experience whenever the script took considerable time to be fetched.
            Since the script requires the DOM to be loaded and ready, I had to
            defer the script so that it could manipulate the DOM. While this did
            work, it wasn't ideal.
          </p>
          {/* What I tried next */}
          <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            I eventually pivoted from this approach and tried to find a way to
            render <span class="shl-inline">.md</span>{" "}
            files programatically as JSX blocks and syntax highlighted them
            individually. Later I realized that this would also not be ideal,
            not only because I would be adding (or creating!) another dependency
            to my website, but it was also unnecessary overhead to parse those
            files and highlight them again and again on every render. Wouldn't
            be better if I could just convert a code block directly as JSX and
            use that on my code instead?

            and how I solved the problem, by creating a tool that creates the
            JSX for me that I can just copy and paste in my files. If it wasn't
            for the fact that I chose to add a theme switcher to this website,
            this page would be one of the many that ship 0 Javascript since I
            got rid of that requirement.

            For now, I'm only gonna mention that the Fresh, until this day (July
            7th, 2023), uses an implementation of Twind v0, which is based on
            Tailwind v2 (superseded by v3 in December of 2021). If you are used
            to Tailwind v3 (which I had nearly 1 year of experience when I
            started this website), a lot of things don't exist in this version
            and a lot others are completely mismatched and will make you
            question how much you really know of Tailwind.
          </p>
          <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            It's a very gaslighting experience to type out some class, have it
            not work and then wonder if you wrote it correctly or not. You
            inspect the element and see that the class wasn't attached, then you
            check tailwind documentation and see that the class exists as you
            tried to use it, then you eventually realize that the issue is that
            it exists in Tailwind v3, but not in v2. It's an experience that I
            don't wish upon anyone, really.

            That might not make sense because this blog post is quite long and
            it mostly talks about the things I dislike, but I promise that it is
            still a net positive for my workflow. While annoying, none of those
            things mentioned managed to strangle how enjoyable it is to work
            with Deno.

            Deno wasn't built in a day (in fact, it has recently turned 5 years
            old) and the Deno team is very hard-working. I wasn't there for the
            first 5 years of Node either, but I'm sure it faced from a myriad of
            issues as well, probably even more than Deno did because the team
            running Deno now is more experienced than the team that started Node
            15 years ago. I don't know exactly where Deno is going to be in the
            next 5 years, but I'm buckled up and ready for the ride. Onto the
            10th birthday! 🚀
