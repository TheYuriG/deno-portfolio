            This course helped me brushing up my React skillset. Although I had
            8 months of prior freelance experience with React when I started
            this course, I learned a lot of fundamentals that I didn't know and
            I now feel that I have a very strong foundation of how React works
            internally because of this. I was able to make some improvements to
            this website because I finally learned how to apply{" "}

            Another great course by Academind. Helped me SOLIDify my Clean Code
            concepts. Was also the first time I've seen polymorphism being used
            in a way that made sense.
