            For some good portion of the most last decade, I was using the
            majority of my free time earning some of the hardest trophies out
            there on PSN, never shying away from the next hard game to complete.

            Trophy hunting, while fun, often times can feel like another job.
            You often feel like you have to track so many moving parts at once
            to make sure you don't miss anything and you stay efficient.

            In late 2017, I felt like trophy hunting would be greatly improved
            if we could get a way to link and display our trophies on Discord,
            but no bots out there offered this kind of data.
          </p>
          <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            After searching far and wide and not really getting anywhere with
            it, in March 2018 I decided that if no one was willing to create a
            Discord bot for trophy hunting, then I was going to need to{" "}

              title="Just like Thanos"
              customRel="noopener noreferrer"
            />. And so I did, I learned how to write Javascript and started
            Yura.

            I've kept maintainining and adding new features to Yura for several
            years, before it ultimately collapsed when its data source killed
            all external access by implementing a stronger DDoS protection
            through Cloudflare.

          <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            Myself and a few other members had been asking for several new
            features for years, but ultimately all of our feedback fell in deaf
            ears. It couldn't go on like that anymore, something had to be done
            about it.

            decided to start our own trophy hunting website that would end up
